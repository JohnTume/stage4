This can be especially true when their partner is more passive and the controlling person is likely to triumph in every disagreement that comes up, just because the partner being controlled is more conflict-avoidant in nature or simply exhausted from the fighting that they've done.\",\"Getting You so Tired of Arguing that You'll Relent\"],\n                [\"i22\", \"Whether by subtly making you feel less attractive than they are, constantly reinforcing their professional accomplishments as compared to yours, or even comparing you unfavorably to their exes, controlling people often want you to feel grateful that you are in a relationship with them. This creates a dynamic where you will be more willing to work harder and harder to keep them and make them happy—a dream for someone who wants to dominate a relationship.\",\" Making you feel you don't \\\"measure up\\\" or are unworthy of them\"],\n                [\"i23\",\"Maybe you always assumed you would go to law school, but now your partner is making you feel your grades weren't good enough to get in. Maybe you used to have a lot of drive to own your own business, but your partner tends to think of your ideas as silly and you find you've lost confidence to pursue them further. Often a controlling partner has a way of using you as a weapon against yourself, by planting seeds of doubt about whether you're talented or smart or hard-working enough to make good things happen in your life.\",\"Thwarting Your Professional or Educational Goals by Making You Doubt Yourself\"],\n                [\"i24\",\"From the outside, people may look into abusive relationships and wonder how the victim stuck around for so long. One of the answers is something called trauma bonding. Manipulative, abusive people tend to be cruel to their partners, and hurl insults at them. They sometimes are also physically violent. However, they didn't start off this way when they were reeling in their victim.Manipulators also give their partners intermittent periods of love and compliments to get them to stick around. These moments are given when the partner has \\\"behaved\\\" or has done something right. It's a way of being conditioned, and the victim gets biologically addicted to the emotional push and pull.\", \"Trauma Bonding\"]\n            ]\n\n\n        // console.log(Data.length);\n        let ele = [];\n        for (let i = 0; i < Data.length; i++) {\n            ele.push(//+ Data[i][0]\n                <Card key={Data[i][0]} imgsrc={Data[i][0]} comment={Data[i][1]} sign={Data[i][2]} />\n            )\n        }\n        return ele;\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        // let res = this.create();\n        const {\n            size: {\n                width\n            }\n        } = this.props;\n\n        return (\n            <div className=\"container\">\n                <h1 className='home_header'>Signs of Manipulation</h1>\n                <StackGrid columnWidth={width <= 500 ?
